# Why this asset ?
This Asset is used to simulate what you can see in the Hololens.
Just drag & drop the prefab on your camera.

The measure had been done by hand as you can see in the join photo
![Measure](MeasureByHand.jpg)

It is not the ultra unity pacakage,  
but it allows to evaluate what will be the view of the user without losing 10-20 minutes in compiling.


## Scirpts ?
Some scripts have been done. But will come in few days, when I sure they are ready and when I will know how to publish asset on the asset store.


## Measure
The measurment had been done at to distance.
1. Min distance= When the Hologram image appear in the Hololens.
2. Max distance= at the max distance my hands could draw on the board.
